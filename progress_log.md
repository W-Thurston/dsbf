# DSBF Profiling Engine — Progress Log

This document captures everything we’ve accomplished in the DSBF profiling system so far, along with our plans and open design ideas. Each item is either **completed** ✅ or **on deck** ⏳. Explanations are included for future reference.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 🧱 Project Foundations
- **Engine Framework**
  ✅ Modular engine system (`BaseEngine`, `ProfileEngine`) using a DAG for lazy execution.

- **Timestamped Output + Run History**
  ✅ Every run stores results in `dsbf/outputs/TIMESTAMP/` and logs metadata to `dsbf_run.json`.

- **Polars-First Architecture**
  ✅ Optimized for Polars speed and memory safety, with fallback to pandas where needed.

---

### 📊 Core Profiling Tasks
These form the core summary used in any EDA report:
- ✅ Type inference, null counts, numeric summaries, uniqueness, most frequent values
- ✅ Duplicate row detection, constant value detection

---

### 📏 Extended Profiling Tasks (Profiling Depth: Full)
These deeper metrics are used in later-stage exploration or modeling:
- ✅ Categorical string length analysis
- ✅ Text field summary (character count, word count, average word length)
- ✅ Correlations, entropy, skewness
- ✅ ID detection, high cardinality flags
- ✅ First/last row samples

---

### 🌐 Visual Profiling Tasks
- ✅ Missingness matrix and heatmap generated using `missingno`
- ✅ Saved in `outputs/TIMESTAMP/figs/` for easy viewing
- ✅ Will be embedded into the report in future layout work

---

### 📈 DAG Visualization
- ✅ Visual DAG saved to `dag.png` with status color coding
- ✅ Supports left-to-right and top-down layouts using Graphviz
- ✅ Makes debugging and understanding engine structure easy

---

### 🔍 Stage Inference System
- ✅ `stage_inference.py` uses null %, cardinality, type ratios to infer stage
- ✅ Configurable thresholds stored in `example_config.yaml`
- ✅ Stage noted in `run_metadata` and displayed at top of Markdown report
- ✅ Used to prioritize what gets highlighted in the future

---

## 🧠 DESIGNED, DISCUSSED, AND ON DECK

### 🧭 Smart Report Layout
These features will help turn the report from a dump into a guided walkthrough:
- ⏳ Reorder sections based on inferred stage (e.g., show missingness early in raw stage)
- ⏳ Add context-sensitive guidance ("This column may be an ID")
- ⏳ Group related sections (e.g., all categorical summaries together)
- ⏳ Embed figures inline where relevant (e.g., missingness plots)

---

### 🎯 Use Case Enhancements
- ✅ Use case 1: **Create a robust, shareable data dictionary**
- ✅ Use case 2: **Skim and understand a dataset quickly**
- ⏳ Use case 3: **Embed DSBF into pipelines for onboarding or CI**
- ⏳ Use case 4: **Support feature engineering or model-readiness assessment**

---

### 🧠 Architectural Ideas (Future-Facing)
- ⏳ Add `tags` to tasks (e.g., summary, visual, diagnostic) to control visibility or grouping
- ⏳ Add fine-grained report controls (`report_sections: [...]`)
- ⏳ Baseline monitoring: compare profile to previous run for drift or schema change
- ⏳ Simple CLI entry point or Python API interface for batch processing

---

### 💡 Experimental / Conceptual
- ⏳ Use inferred stage as a lens, not a filter — surface key insights early
- ⏳ Provide “Why this matters” footnotes in report (esp. for novice users)
- ⏳ Auto-suggest cleaning actions (e.g., unify string categories)
- ⏳ Let users annotate fields (e.g., “target”, “join key”, “PII”)

This file is intended as a living roadmap and log. It should be updated after each major milestone or feature push.
