# ===================
# TRANSFORMATION
# ===================

mild_skew_transform:
  condition: "skew > 1 or skew < -1"
  applicable_to:
    - detect_skewness
    - suggest_numerical_binning
  message: >
    This feature is moderately skewed. Consider log or power transforms
    to improve linear model performance or reduce sensitivity to outliers.

high_cardinality_feature:
  condition: "n_unique > 50"
  applicable_to:
    - detect_high_cardinality
  message: >
    This feature has high cardinality. Consider using frequency encoding,
    target encoding, or dimensionality reduction to avoid sparse features.

# ===================
# LEAKAGE / REDUNDANCY
# ===================

drop_encoded_column:
  condition: "match_type in ['base64', 'uuid', 'hex']"
  applicable_to:
    - detect_encoded_columns
  message: >
    This column appears to be encoded and is unlikely to generalize well.
    Drop it unless it has domain-specific meaning.

drop_duplicate_column:
  condition: "correlation_with == 1.0"
  applicable_to:
    - detect_duplicate_columns
  message: >
    This column is a perfect duplicate of another — remove one to avoid redundant signals.

leaky_feature:
  condition: "correlation_with_target > 0.99"
  applicable_to:
    - detect_data_leakage
  message: >
    This feature is nearly identical to the target — likely due to leakage.
    Drop it unless it was intentionally derived from the target.

drop_constant_column:
  condition: "n_unique == 1"
  applicable_to:
    - detect_constant_columns
  message: >
    This feature has the same value for all rows — drop it before modeling.

# ===================
# LOW INFORMATION VALUE
# ===================

drop_zero_variance:
  condition: "variance < 1e-4"
  applicable_to:
    - detect_near_zero_variance
  message: >
    This feature has near-zero variance and is unlikely to help model performance.
    Drop it unless it encodes rare but meaningful events.

# ===================
# COLLINEARITY
# ===================

high_vif_feature:
  condition: "vif > 10"
  applicable_to:
    - detect_collinear_features
  message: >
    This feature has high collinearity with others, which may distort model coefficients.
    Consider dropping, combining, or using regularization.

# ===================
# CLASS IMBALANCE
# ===================

severe_class_imbalance:
  condition: "majority_ratio >= 0.9"
  applicable_to:
    - detect_class_imbalance
  message: >
    Your target is highly imbalanced. Use stratified sampling, up/down-sampling,
    or metrics like ROC-AUC instead of accuracy.

# ===================
# DRIFT DETECTION
# ===================

high_drift_score:
  condition: "psi >= 0.2"
  applicable_to:
    - detect_feature_drift
  message: >
    This feature shows significant drift vs. the reference dataset.
    Monitor closely or retrain your model periodically.
